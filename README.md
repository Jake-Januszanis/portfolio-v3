## Description

This my latest portfolio build that I created to showcase some of my recent projects. My last portfolio was alright and did its job but alright wasn’t good enough for me. I wanted a portfolio that would stand out. So I hopped on Figma and decided to completely redesign the layout and came up with this. I don’t consider myself to be a web designer by any means but I really like how this came out in the end. It’s simple, easy to navigate, and fully responsive on all screen sizes. I will continue to keep updating and making small changes for a better user experience. 

## Technology/Tools Used

- Gatsby
- React
- JavaScript
- SCSS
- Netlify
- Figma

## What I learned 

- For the first time ever I used Figma to design the site before actually writing any code. Having a general design concept before diving in made the building process way easier. Not nearly as much backtracking as some of my other projects.

- General web design principles. Concepts that I’ve overlooked in the past such as color selection for improved contrast and readability or even something as small as letter spacing or characters per line, are now on my radar and will be implemented into any future projects.
